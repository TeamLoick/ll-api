Lolinck is an open source API that use machine learning to detect if a website is safe or not. Detect NSFW, phishing, malware, ip logging and more. This API was powered by [LoickTeam](https://dsc.gg/loick).

## Getting started
We have a lot of samples in our [documentation](https://lolinck.vercel.app/) for the most famous programming languages. We also have libraries for python and for nodejs. Or you can only make a simple request to our API. However you have to know that we put a limit for free users. If you are a free user you can only make 1 request per 2 seconds., and 1 million requests per month. If you want to remove this limit you can buy a premium plan. If you want to know about our premium tier check visit the next page.

## How it works
Now we are in the process to recolect enought data to train our AI. To check links we check the content of the website, the code and the headers. We also check in our db and the biggest public db of links.
