Lolinck is an open source API that use machine learning to detect if a website is safe or not. It can detect NSFW, phishing, malware, ip logging and more.

## Getting started
We have a lot of samples in our [documentation](https://lolinck.vercel.app/) for the most famous programming languages. We also have libraries for python and for nodejs. Or you can only make a simple request to our API. However you have to know that we put a limit for free users. If you are a free user you can only make 1 request per 2 seconds., and 1 million requests per month. If you want to remove this limit you can buy a premium plan. If you want to know about our premium tier check visit the next page.

## How it works
The API use 3 methods to detect if a website is safe or not.
### The first method
is check in our db that we expand with the results of other methods. This db has also content from public dbs.

### The second method
is the logical method where we check the content of the page, the headers and all the information about the page to give a results. <br />

### The third method
that continues under development is the AI that have been trained with a lot of data from our db to detect if website is safe or not.
